# Password_Generator

> This project is to showcase how javascript can interact with the web browser using DOM.
The project uses a validated textbox so users can enter in the length of the password they want to generate.
Users can also select if they want to use lower, upper, numbers, and/or special characters.
The code will then generate a password if the length enter in between 8 and 128 chars, and one checkbox must checked, other wise the code will stop
